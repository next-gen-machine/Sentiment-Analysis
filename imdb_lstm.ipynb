       "array([\"I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with those parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. This might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. That is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.<br /><br />The camera goes to a person about to get eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. And so on.<br /><br />The costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I don't care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half-person half-shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.<br /><br />The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. It might be a good one to MST3K with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the channel.\",\n",
       "       'There are two groups of people...those who love every Fellini movie they see and normal people. While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films, I can also honestly say that I can\\'t stand some of them. My opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--I have seen most of Fellini\\'s films and have also seen many films by the world\\'s most famous directors. With this in mind, I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini. They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the \"intelligensia\", while the average person would never sit through some of their films. Heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. So, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it\\'s not surprising that their films are so often praised--it\\'s like a cult! If you don\\'t believe me, think about many of Godard\\'s films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE,...or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS? These films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. Now I am NOT saying a film can\\'t be weird (after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER), but it must be watchable!<br /><br />Now on to this movie. Somehow, Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. This is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. Instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul. I know some of this must have been Fellini\\'s intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since Sutherland\\'s lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! Unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn\\'t anything else to watch.<br /><br />An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini\\'s wife, Giulietta Masina. Considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting. Don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you!',\n",
       "       'This movie was a major disappointment on direction, intellectual niveau, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject, painting. It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years, with appalling lack of depth though. It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as \"beauty\". According to the makers of this movie, \\'beauty\\' can be only experienced in Bob-Ross-style kitschy landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment. In parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated (rather, celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless \\'bullshit\\' (quote).<br /><br />I do not understand how the movie could get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and they chose for only very high or very low grades.',\n",

       "       'OK, this is one strange film! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the \"inventive\" techniques director George Barry utilizes, like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. He can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! There is more humor than horror here, but I found it an uneven blend. You will be laughing and crying, and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972, and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $10,000. That\\'s 59 months and $9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the campy side, with vintage \\'70s \"gore\", you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack.',\n",
       "       \"This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time. However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point being, Disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love. I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!\",\n",
       "       'Being born in the 1960\\'s I grew up watching the TV \"Movies of the Week\" in the early 70\\'s and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including \"Crowhaven Farm\", \"Bad Ronald\", \"Satan\\'s School for Girls\", \"Kolchak the Night Stalker\", etc, but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writer\\'s trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of \"McCloud\" and \"Duel\" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver\\'s pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. For God\\'s sake, call the police, beat the hell of them or something, just don\\'t sit there and whine about it. The acting is pretty lame, the story unbelievable, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that\\'s about it. Ignore this if it ever airs on TV.'],\n",

uneven overthetop flicks that satisfied masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship common sense damned on whole dillinger typical for its era entertaining worth couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action short on both acting historical fact dillinger was fair effort by screenwriterdirector john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive careerthe 109minute dillinger epic for aips scope follows quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips prostitute of french indian extraction while taking place over several months in 19334 dillinger basically chase film with purviss entourage looking to run down kill off men wanted by j edgar hooverdillinger has documentary feel listing dates places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons buildings he also sprinkles around blackandwhite photography stock footage of gangster shootouts film never boring moving at quick if haphazard pace action scenes are dillingers strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film certainly not for squeamish with people getting shot dropping dead all over place violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of mayhem that organized crime dumped on american lifethis film never transcends its exploitation status however because needed writing just isnt there john milius somewhat overrated as filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action action scenes mostly bloodfilled shootouts are impressive comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967s bonnie clyde but we simply dont get to know much about dillinger his gang members as people vital relationship that develops between dillinger frechette barely touched upon with pair meeting in bar during one scene cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in out of storyline becoming prominent figure only when milius needs to keep film from unraveling all too often film takes on shootemup persona when its characters could have been explored in detailaside from this pictures main crime ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger just film its films such as this one that create fables make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history point out that john dillinger was not last of his ring to die as miliuss screenplay films documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson homer van meter he also was said not to carrying gun on night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there no reason why milius couldnt have stayed with facts written great story around themwarren oatess performance as dillinger quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates humorous nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his largerthanlife image in american press however we never really feel menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to billie frechette character its really too bad that miliuss screenplay didnt flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to coldblooded killer other than stereotype of an easygoing girl who attracted to men of danger supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis brieflyappearing cloris leachman are acceptable for

follower of abu hamza would he amused if someone did it to one of his daughtersover all years ive perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man rosss chat show because i find him so loathsome some of guests i saw were ok though probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know as chat show it seems pretty poor though \\x96 whats so chatty about asking tory leader david cameron on

totally exposed with above revelations i thought id take opportunity to warn few decent folk around world who might not know just how vile this man to steer clear of him his unless you think all

evidence in case they got prosecuted significant number of people over here probably most of them non bbc license fee payers found it hilarious andor that national scandal had been overblown but many people apparently still knew right from wrong 42851 eventually complained to bbc about incident many unrighteous media fools others snickered about these 42851 never having heard radio programme never wanting to using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as holocaust justified because at time relatively few people complained to media none of us here now should horrified by it because we werent there 2 bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was very funny brilliant comedy only 2 people complained about brands radio programme at time which im afraid only indicated moral level his 400000 weekly listeners had sunk to with help of bbc expertise highly moral bbc tried failed to use it in mitigation in later ofcom investigation roll over aristotle tell lord reith news sachs agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until tory national newspaper got hold of story penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally sacking prosecution maybe even prison but while brand head of bbc radio 2 were both eventually ordered to resign multimillionaire ross was given 12 week holiday by bbcs boss i suppose that he asked rosss permission first though if he could dock rosss pay by £1500000 to prevent him from suing to come back to this programme afresh in 2009 before his contract runs out all that time to think of more smut andor more insulting witlessness for his 4000000 viewers to admire but at least he could still chortle his way to bank as usual to keep his spirits up some people think that his position untenable he wont able to carry on i think his skin so thick because stakes are so high that he come back unbowed reenergised with pent up vitriol update 230109 ive just watched first 5 minutes of his new series
